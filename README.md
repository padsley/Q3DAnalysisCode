# Q3DAnalysisCode
Online repository for my Q3D analysis code for converting focal-plane position to excitation energy

This is my online backup of my Q3D analysis code now fixed (!) so I can do transfer reactions - I've also fixed a totes weird error where all of my excitation energies were shifted by 1.8ish MeV for some reason. Which I don't understand. It is the Q-value of the reaction that I was considering though which is deeply suspicious.

Cos this is mainly my own back-up of a code then it's not properly documented - send me an e-mail/head in a box/make an issue on the repo if you have problems and want to angrily rant at someone for their idiocy. :)

I should not drink and write readme but I'm a holiday sooo... *shrug*
